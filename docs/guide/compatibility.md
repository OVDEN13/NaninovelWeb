# Compatibility

## Unity Version

Minimum supported Unity version is **2019.4**; this won't change throughout Naninovel v1.x releases. Support for new releases from [TECH stream](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/04/09/new-plans-for-unity-releases-introducing-the-tech-and-long-term-support-lts-streams/) is added once they're out of beta.

It's recommended to stay on the latest [2019 LTS stream](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2019.4) to minimize production risks.

## Platforms

All the engine features are implemented using cross-platform APIs and are expected to be compatible with all the platforms Unity can target. 

The following platforms were tested for compatibility:
* Standalone: PC, Mac, Linux
* WebGL
* iOS
* Android
* UWP (IL2CPP scripting backend only)

## Render Pipelines

Unity's [scriptable render pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/render-pipelines.html) (both URP and HDRP) are supported with some limitations and require additional setup; see [render pipelines guide](/guide/render-pipelines.md) for more information.

## Managed Stripping

"Medium" and "High" [managed bytecode stripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeStripping.html) profiles are not supported. Either disable the stripping or use the "Low" profile (set by default).
